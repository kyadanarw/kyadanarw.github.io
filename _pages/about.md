<p align="justify">My name is Khin Yadanar Win. I am a postdoctoral researcher in Computer Engineering at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.</p>

<p align="justify">My research focuses on developing computer-aided diagnosis algorithms to detect the diseases on medical images using image processing and machine learning and observing their impacts on the healthcare. I have made several contributions to the developement of automated disease detection models. My current interests are medical image analysis, healthcare informatics, machine learning , deep learning, and ethical AI.</p>

<p align="justify">Previously I obtained Doctor of Engineering from King Monkut's Institute of Technology Ladkraband, where I worked with Dr. Somsak Choomchuay, Dr. Noppadol Maneerat and Dr. Hazuhiko HAMAMOTO. Before that I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Dagon University.</p>
