<p align="justify">My name is Khin Yadanar Win. I am a postdoctoral researcher in Computer Engineering at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.</p>

<p align="justify">My research focuses on developing computer-aided diagnosis algorithms to detect the diseases on medical images using image processing and machine learning and observing their impacts on the healthcare. I have been working on detection of eye diseases on fundus images of retina, detection and classificaiton of cancerous cells on microscopic images of cytology pleural effusion,and detection and visualization of infections lung diseases on chest X-ray scans, and have made several contributions to the developement of automated disease detection models. My current interests are medical image analysis, healthcare informatics, machine learning, deep learning, and ethical AI. I have a keen interest on how AI is going to solve the healthcare issues.</p>

<p align="justify">Previously I obtained Doctor of Engineering from King Monkut's Institute of Technology Ladkraband, where I worked with Dr. Somsak Choomchuay, Dr. Noppadol Maneerat and Dr. Hazuhiko HAMAMOTO. Before that I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Dagon University.</p>
