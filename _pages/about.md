<p align="justify">I am a postdoctoral scholar in Computer Engineering at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.</p>

<p align="justify">My research focuses on developing computer-aided diagnosis algorithms to detect diseases on medical images using image processing and machine learning and observing their impacts on healthcare. I have been working on the detection of eye diseases on fundus images of the retina, detection, and classification of cancerous cells on microscopic images of cytology pleural effusion, and detection and visualization of infections and lung diseases on chest X-ray scans, and have made several contributions to the development of automated disease detection models. My current interests are medical image analysis, healthcare informatics, machine learning, deep learning, and ethical AI. I have a keen interest in how AI is going to solve healthcare issues.</p>

<p align="justify">Previously I obtained a Doctor of Engineering from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkraband, where I worked with Dr. Somsak Choomchuay, Dr. Noppadol Maneerat, and Dr. Hazuhiko HAMAMOTO. Before that, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Dagon University.</p> <br/>
